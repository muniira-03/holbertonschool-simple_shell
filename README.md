# Simple Shell

Welcome to our **Simple Shell** project ðŸ‘‹  
This project is part of the low-level programming curriculum at Holberton School.  
The goal is to build our own simple UNIX command-line interpreter (shell) that mimics some functionalities of `/bin/sh`.

---

## ðŸ“š Description

This shell reads commands from the standard input and executes them just like a regular shell.  
It supports both **interactive** and **non-interactive** modes. It handles execution of simple commands using system calls like `fork`, `execve`, `wait`, and more.  
It also supports a few **built-in commands** such as `exit`, `env`, and handles `$PATH` lookups.

- Non-Interactvie Mode
